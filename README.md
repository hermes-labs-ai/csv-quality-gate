csv-quality-gate is a command-line data quality gate that runs CSV preflight validation, failing fast before a pipeline ingests broken, incomplete, duplicated, or junk input.

It runs batch quality checks on a CSV and returns `pass`, `warn`, or `fail` (with matching exit codes) before expensive pipeline steps burn time on bad input. It checks for missing required columns, empty files, empty critical cells, duplicate rows, and — under the `outreach` profile — suspicious company-name patterns. Teams can declare their own columns, thresholds, and patterns in a small TOML/JSON config, every issue points at the affected line numbers (never cell values), and the same gate runs as a pre-commit hook or a GitHub Action. It is stdlib-only: no third-party runtime dependencies.

The problems it is built for:

- "We keep running expensive pipeline steps on broken CSVs."
- "A batch run fails 20 minutes in because the input CSV was junk."
- "We only discover missing required columns after the job already started."
- "Duplicate rows and empty contact fields keep polluting our batch runs."
- "The gate says 12% duplicates, but which rows?"
- "Our CSVs have `email` and `order_id`, not `company`."
- "I want CSV preflight validation, not a whole data platform."

## Quickstart (60 seconds)

```bash
pip install csv-quality-gate
csv-quality-gate check leads.csv --profile outreach
```

Example output for a CSV with a missing column and a borderline duplicate rate:

```text
csv-quality-gate: FAIL
file: leads.csv
profile: outreach
rows: 125
  ERROR: missing required column: person_name
  WARNING: duplicate rate 12% exceeds warning threshold 10%
    evidence: column=company affected=15 rows at line(s) 4, 9, 15, 22, 31 (+10 more)
```

The process exits `0` on pass, `1` on warnings only, and `2` on fail, so you can wire it directly into a shell script, a pre-commit hook, or a CI step.

## Install

```bash
pip install csv-quality-gate
```

For development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

```bash
csv-quality-gate check leads.csv
csv-quality-gate check leads.csv --profile outreach
csv-quality-gate check leads.csv --profile generic --json
csv-quality-gate check leads.csv --config csv-quality-gate.toml --profile leads
csv-quality-gate check leads.csv --max-examples 20
csv-quality-gate check data/*.csv
```

Options for `check`:

- `--profile NAME` — a built-in profile (`generic`, `outreach`) or one declared in `--config`.
- `--config FILE` — TOML or JSON file with project-specific profiles (see [Custom profiles](#custom-profiles)).
- `--max-examples N` — how many affected line numbers each issue lists (default `5`; `0` keeps counts only).
- `--json` — machine-readable output.

Several paths can be checked in one call. Text mode prints one block per file,
JSON mode emits an array (a single path keeps the plain object), and the exit
code is the worst status across files.

Exit codes:

- `0` pass
- `1` warnings only
- `2` fail (or `2` when the file does not exist, is not UTF-8, the profile is unknown, or the config is invalid)

## Profiles

Built-in profiles:

- `generic`
  - checks for a required `company` column, empty `company` cells, duplicate `company` values, and empty files
- `outreach`
  - requires `company` and `person_name`, with higher empty-rate tolerances and an added suspicious company-name heuristic for GTM/contact pipelines

The thresholds for each profile are defined in `src/csv_quality_gate/profiles.py`.

### Custom profiles

Declare your own profiles in a TOML (Python 3.11+) or JSON file and pass it
with `--config`. A copyable example lives in
[`examples/csv-quality-gate.toml`](examples/csv-quality-gate.toml).

```toml
[profiles.leads]
extends = "outreach"                 # optional: inherit a built-in's columns, patterns, and rates
required_columns = ["email", "company", "person_name"]
critical_columns = ["email", "person_name"]
duplicate_column = "email"
empty_warning_rate = 0.05
empty_fail_rate = 0.20
duplicate_warning_rate = 0.02
duplicate_fail_rate = 0.10
suspicious_column = "email"
suspicious_patterns = ['^[^@]+$']    # case-insensitive regular expressions
suspicious_warning_rate = 0.20
suspicious_fail_rate = 0.50
```

```bash
csv-quality-gate check data/leads.csv --config csv-quality-gate.toml --profile leads
```

Rules:

- Every key is optional. Without `extends`, a profile starts with no columns,
  no patterns, and the `generic` thresholds.
- A rate of `0.0` means "any occurrence": a check with no affected rows never
  raises an issue, so a clean file still passes.
- Config is data only: column names, rates between `0` and `1`, and regex
  strings. Unknown keys, out-of-range rates, a warning rate above its fail rate,
  and invalid regexes are rejected with a precise message, and the CLI returns a
  normal `fail` receipt (exit `2`) instead of a traceback.
- Built-ins stay available next to your profiles. A custom profile with the same
  name as a built-in replaces it for that run only.
- Regexes come from your own repository; keep them simple, since the gate does
  not guard against pathological patterns.

## Output

Text mode (default):

```text
csv-quality-gate: FAIL
file: leads.csv
profile: outreach
rows: 125
  ERROR: missing required column: person_name
  WARNING: duplicate rate 12% exceeds warning threshold 10%
    evidence: column=company affected=15 rows at line(s) 4, 9, 15, 22, 31 (+10 more)
```

Every empty-rate, duplicate-rate, and suspicious-value issue carries bounded
evidence: the affected column, the total number of affected rows, and up to
`--max-examples` physical line numbers (the header is line 1; a quoted record
that spans several lines reports its last line). Cell values are never printed,
so receipts stay safe to attach to CI logs or tickets. Duplicate evidence points
at the second and later occurrences, so those are the lines to remove.

JSON mode (`--json`) emits an object with `path`, `profile`, `rows`, `status`,
`issues[]`, and (when `--config` is used) `config`. Each issue has `severity`
and `message`; issues backed by rows add an `evidence` object:

```bash
csv-quality-gate check leads.csv --json
```

```json
{
  "path": "leads.csv",
  "profile": "outreach",
  "rows": 125,
  "status": "fail",
  "issues": [
    {"severity": "error", "message": "missing required column: person_name"},
    {
      "severity": "warning",
      "message": "duplicate rate 12% exceeds warning threshold 10%",
      "evidence": {"column": "company", "total": 15, "rows": [4, 9, 15, 22, 31]}
    }
  ]
}
```

## Limitations / What it does not do

- Heuristics are intentionally simple: empty-rate, duplicate-rate, and regex-based name patterns. They do not learn from your data.
- It validates shape and obvious noise, not semantic correctness — it cannot tell whether `company` values are real, only whether they are present, unique, and not obviously junk.
- The `outreach` profile is opinionated. Its suspicious-name patterns and thresholds were chosen for GTM contact lists and should not be treated as universal truth.
- Duplicate and empty checks operate on the columns a profile names; it does not auto-detect which columns matter. Built-ins use `company` and `person_name`; use a config file for anything else.
- Evidence is line numbers and counts only. It never quotes cell values, so it cannot tell you *what* a bad value was, only where it is.
- It validates each CSV file independently and assumes UTF-8 (BOM-tolerant), comma-separated input.
- It is not a data quality platform: no lineage, no profiling reports, no schema inference, no row-level remediation.

## When to use it

- Before enrichment, outreach, ETL, or batch scoring runs
- As a pre-commit hook or CI step for checked-in CSV inputs
- As a preflight gate before expensive pipeline work

## When not to use it

- When you need semantic validation of the data itself
- When your input is not CSV
- When you need a full data quality framework with lineage and profiling

## pre-commit

Run the same gate on staged CSV files before they are committed. Add this to
your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (full example in
[`examples/pre-commit-config.yaml`](examples/pre-commit-config.yaml)):

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/hermes-labs-ai/csv-quality-gate
    rev: v0.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: csv-quality-gate
        args: [--profile, outreach]
        # or: args: [--config, csv-quality-gate.toml, --profile, leads]
```

The hook receives every staged `.csv` file, prints one report block per file,
and blocks the commit on `warn` or `fail`, matching the CLI exit codes. Narrow
it with pre-commit's `files:` pattern if only some CSVs should be gated, and
tune thresholds through a config file rather than skipping the hook.

To try the hook from a local checkout before pinning a release, point a
config at the checkout path and a commit:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: /path/to/csv-quality-gate
    rev: <commit sha>
    hooks:
      - id: csv-quality-gate
        args: [--profile, outreach]
```

```bash
pre-commit run --config that-file.yaml csv-quality-gate --files data/leads.csv
```

`pre-commit try-repo . csv-quality-gate --files data/leads.csv` also works for
the default `generic` profile (try-repo cannot pass hook `args`).

## CI / GitHub Actions

Use this repository directly as a composite Action. It installs the packaged CLI,
runs the selected profile, and always writes a JSON receipt at
`$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/csv-quality-gate-receipt.json`. The `status` and `receipt`
outputs remain available even when the Action exits with a warning or failure.

```yaml
- id: csv_gate
  uses: hermes-labs-ai/csv-quality-gate@v0.3.0
  with:
    csv-path: data/leads.csv
    profile: leads
    config: csv-quality-gate.toml   # optional; omit to use built-in profiles

- run: echo "${{ steps.csv_gate.outputs.status }}"
```

The only inputs are `csv-path`, `profile`, and the optional `config` file path;
the Action deliberately accepts no free-form command or shell arguments. It
returns the same exit codes as the CLI: `0` for pass, `1` for warn, and `2` for
fail. The receipt contains the same bounded evidence as `--json`, so it is safe
to upload as a workflow artifact.
Use `continue-on-error: true` on a calling step if your workflow needs to inspect
warning or failure outputs before deciding how to proceed.

The receipt path is fixed per workspace, so do not run more than one instance in
parallel in the same workspace. The Action validates the package's existing CSV
heuristics only; it does not add schema inference, semantic verification, or
arbitrary CLI options.

A ready-to-copy install-based workflow also lives in
[`examples/github-action.yml`](examples/github-action.yml).

## Development
